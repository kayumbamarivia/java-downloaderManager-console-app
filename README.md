# Website Downloader Console Application

## Overview
The Website Downloader is a Java-based console application designed to download an entire website, including its homepage and all external resources (such as images, stylesheets, and scripts). The application allows users to input a website URL, download its homepage, extract all external links, and download corresponding resources. The project also tracks download progress and generates a detailed download report.

This tool helps to create a local copy of a website for offline browsing, while storing metadata related to the download operation in a relational database.

## Features
- **Download a website homepage**: Given a URL, the application downloads the homepage of the website.
- **Extract external links**: Extracts all external links from the homepage and stores them in a database.
- **Download external resources**: Downloads resources like images, scripts, and stylesheets linked from the homepage.
- **Track progress**: Displays the progress of each resource download in the console.
- **Generate download reports**: After the download, the system generates a report showing the overall progress and statistics of the website download.
- **Database integration**: Stores metadata like the website name, download start and end times, and download progress in a relational database.

## System Requirements
- **Java 8 or higher**: The application is built using Java 8.
- **MySQL Database**: Used for storing website download metadata and external links.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and building the project.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:
- **WebsiteRepository**: Handles interactions with the database, including creating tables and inserting records for websites, links, and download progress.
- **DownloadService**: Manages the download process for the homepage and linked resources.
- **ProgressReporter**: Tracks and reports the download progress of each resource.
- **Database Setup**: Uses MySQL to store data about downloaded websites, links, and progress.
